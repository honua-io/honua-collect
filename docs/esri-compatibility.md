# Esri compatibility matrix

What Honua Collect supports versus **Esri ArcGIS Survey123**, **Esri Field
Maps**, and **Fulcrum** — grounded in the capabilities actually shipped in this
repository, with partial/planned items marked honestly. Collect speaks the Esri
**GeoServices** protocol natively, so it reads and writes ArcGIS FeatureServers
**with no Esri licence**.

> Legend: ✅ shipped & tested · 🟡 partial / core-done, device-binding or UI
> pending · 🔭 planned · — not applicable / not offered.
>
> Honesty note: Collect's `Honua.Collect.Core` logic and
> `Honua.Collect.Presentation` (MVVM) layers are real and unit-tested. Several
> **device "last-mile" bindings** (camera, GNSS, map surface) live in the
> `Honua.Collect.App` MAUI shell and are still being wired — those are marked 🟡

## Esri GeoServices / FeatureServer protocol

This is the interop moat: Collect talks the same wire protocol Survey123 and
Field Maps use, so it round-trips against any FeatureServer (Honua-hosted or
ArcGIS).

| Capability | Honua Collect | Survey123 / Field Maps | Fulcrum | Evidence |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| FeatureServer `query` (read/pull, paged) | ✅ | ✅ | — | [`GeoServicesFeatureSync.QueryAsync`](../src/Honua.Collect.Core/Sync/GeoServicesFeatureSync.cs) — follows `resultOffset`/`resultRecordCount` + `exceededTransferLimit` |
| `applyEdits` — adds | ✅ | ✅ | — | `SubmitAsync` |
| `applyEdits` — updates | ✅ | ✅ | — | `UpdateAsync` |
| `applyEdits` — deletes | ✅ | ✅ | — | `DeleteAsync` |
| `addAttachment` (upload) | ✅ | ✅ | — | `AddAttachmentAsync` (multipart/form-data) |
| `queryAttachments` (download) | 🔭 | ✅ | — | not implemented; only upload today |
| Token auth (`generateToken`) | ✅ | ✅ | — | [`ServerCredentialVerifier`](../src/Honua.Collect.Presentation/Auth/ServerCredentialVerifier.cs) |
| Transient-failure retry with backoff | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | [`FeatureSyncRetryPolicy`](../src/Honua.Collect.Core/Sync/GeoServicesFeatureSync.cs) (exponential + jitter) |
| Reads/writes ArcGIS FeatureServers **without** an Esri licence | ✅ | — | — | the positioning moat ([#37](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/37)) |

The Fulcrum column is `—` here because Fulcrum is not a GeoServices server; you
interoperate with it via export/import (see [migration](#migration--data-portability)).

## Deployment & licensing posture

This is where the matrix flips in Collect's favour — the [#37](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/37)
moat.

| Capability | Honua Collect | Survey123 | Fulcrum | Evidence |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Source-available | ✅ (ELv2) | — | — | [LICENSE](../LICENSE) |
| Self-hostable / on-prem | ✅ | 🟡 (only via costly ArcGIS Enterprise) | — (cloud-only) | [self-hosting guide](./self-hosting.md) |
| Air-gapped capable | ✅ | 🟡 | — | offline capture + offline licence verification |
| No per-seat SaaS tax / user-type tax | ✅ | — (expensive ArcGIS user types) | — (per-seat, 5-user floor) | open-core editions |
| Offline licence/entitlement enforcement (no phone-home) | ✅ | — | — | [`LicenseService`](../src/Honua.Collect.Core/Licensing/LicenseService.cs) (Ed25519, embedded public key) |
| Bring-your-own identity (no Esri/vendor account) | ✅ | — | — | authenticates against your server's token endpoint |

## Migration & data portability

Collect lowers the switching cost from both incumbents — see the full
[migration guide](./migration-from-survey123-and-fulcrum.md):

- **From Survey123:** import the survey's **XLSForm** directly
  ([`XlsFormImporter`](../src/Honua.Collect.Core/Field/Forms/Authoring/XlsFormImporter.cs));
  pull existing feature-layer records over GeoServices.
- **From Fulcrum:** re-express the app's fields onto the same form model; import
  records from Fulcrum's CSV/GeoJSON exports.
- **Out of Collect:** export to CSV, GeoJSON, KML, GeoPackage, or Shapefile — no
  lock-in.

## What is deliberately marked partial / planned (honesty ledger)

To avoid overstating:

- **Device last-mile (🟡):** real camera/GPS/map-surface bindings live in the
  MAUI app and are still being wired ([#35](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/35)).
  The capture **logic** (geometry sessions, media policy, GPS averaging) is done
  and tested; the hardware surfaces are not all bound yet.
- **External GNSS / RTK (🔭):** not implemented — Survey123's surveying moat,
  planned in [#36](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/36).
- **`queryAttachments` (🔭):** only attachment **upload** is implemented; reading
  existing attachments from a server is not.
- **Conflict-review UI (🟡):** field-level detection and merge are complete and
  tested in Core; the review **screen** is pending ([#38](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/38)).
- **Post-sync editability (🔭):** targeted ([#38](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/38)) precisely
  because it is Fulcrum's top complaint — not yet shipped.
- **Token refresh (🟡):** the lifecycle supports proactive refresh, but the
  current `generateToken` endpoint issues no refresh token, so renewal is
  re-sign-in on expiry today.
- **SSO / OIDC / SAML (🔭):** the session model exists; the interactive sign-in
  flow is planned ([#7](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/7)).
- **Bulk + templated PDF/Word reporting (🟡):** exporters and a per-record
  renderer exist and are Pro-gated; the finished bulk/report UX is tracked in
  [#39](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/39).
- **Background sync / push (🔭):** app-layer, planned ([#35](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-collect/issues/35)).
